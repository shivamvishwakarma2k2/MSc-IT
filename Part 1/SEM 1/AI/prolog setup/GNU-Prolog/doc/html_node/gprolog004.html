<h2 class="section" id="sec4">3&#XA0;&#XA0;Introduction</h2>
<p>GNU Prolog [<a href="gprolog073.html#gnu-prolog">5</a>] is a free Prolog compiler with constraint
solving over finite domains. For recent information about GNU Prolog
please consult <a href="http://www.gprolog.org">the GNU Prolog page</a>.</p><p><a id="hevea_default0"></a> GNU Prolog is a Prolog compiler
based on the Warren Abstract Machine (<a id="hevea_default1"></a>WAM) [<a href="gprolog073.html#Warren83">9</a>, <a href="gprolog073.html#Ait-Kaci91">1</a>].
It first compiles a Prolog program to a WAM file which is then translated to
a low-level machine independent language called <a id="hevea_default2"></a>mini-assembly
specifically designed for GNU Prolog. The resulting file is then translated
to the assembly language of the target machine (from which an object is
obtained). This allows GNU Prolog to produce a native stand alone executable
from a Prolog source (similarly to what does a C compiler from a C program).
The main advantage of this compilation scheme is to produce native code and
to be fast. Another interesting feature is that executables are small.
Indeed, the code of most unused built-in predicates is not included in the
executables at link-time.</p><p>A lot of work has been devoted to the ISO compatibility. Indeed, GNU Prolog
is very close to the ISO standard for Prolog&#XA0;[<a href="gprolog073.html#iso-part1">6</a>].</p><p>GNU Prolog also offers various extensions very useful in practice (global
variables, OS interface, sockets,...). In particular, GNU Prolog contains an
efficient constraint solver over Finite Domains (FD). This opens constraint
logic programming to the user combining the power of constraint programming to
the declarativity of logic programming. The key feature of the GNU Prolog
solver is the use of a single (low-level) primitive to define all
(high-level) FD constraints. There are many advantages of this approach:
constraints can be compiled, the user can define his own constraints (in
terms of the primitive), the solver is open and extensible (as opposed to
black-box solvers like CHIP),&#X2026;Moreover, the GNU Prolog solver is rather
efficient, often more than commercial solvers.</p><p>GNU Prolog is inspired from two systems:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize"><span class="c003">wamcc</span>: a Prolog to C compiler [<a href="gprolog073.html#wamcc">3</a>]. the key point of <span class="c003">wamcc</span> was its
ability to produce stand alone executables using an original compilation
scheme: the translation of Prolog to C via the WAM. Its drawback was the time
needed by <span class="c003">gcc</span> to compile the produced sources. GNU Prolog can also
produce stand alone executables but using a faster compilation scheme.</li><li class="li-itemize"><span class="c003">clp(FD)</span>: a constraint programming language over FD
[<a href="gprolog073.html#long-clp-fd">4</a>]. Its key feature was the use of a
single primitive to define FD constraints. GNU Prolog is based on the same
idea but offers an extended constraint definition language. In comparison to
<span class="c003">clp(FD)</span>, GNU Prolog offers new predefined constraints, new
predefined heuristics, reified constraints,&#X2026;</li></ul><p>Here are some features of GNU Prolog:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">Prolog system:<ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">conforms to the ISO standard for Prolog (floating point numbers,
